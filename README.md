# ReadyToDye

This is a game developed by five during the 2nd semester of a BA Game Design course.  
Assets were completely made by me.

## The concept

We wanted to make a 2D puzzle game that works with colors and shifting perspective to get to the endgoal.  
The player controls two player characters that both have to get to the end to win the level.

## Have a look!

This repository contains the entire Unity project, NOT the build.  
To play, run the Unity Editor and play inside it.
